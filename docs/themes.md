# Built-in themes

HEpigram comes with the full [MkDocs set of themes](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/styling-your-docs/#built-in-themes). To choose one of them, simply use the `--theme` flag (or `theme` configuration entry) with the respective theme name.

# Custom themes

You can, of course, create custom themes to be used by HEpigram and MkDocs.

### Basics

Since HEpigram uses MkDocs on the background, a custom theme that works on MkDocs will work on HEpigram. Please, refer to [MkDocs' Custom Themes](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/custom-themes/) documentation to learn how to create a basic theme.

### HEpigram-ness

As you've seen above, Jinja2 allows a very powerful and customizable theme to be created. In the near future we plan to add our own macros on top of Jinja and MkDocs. We'll update this document when its done.
